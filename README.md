### Local Recording
<details>
  <summary>See more</summary>
  
* Local Recording records the browser window video and audio. From the list of media formats that your  browser supports you can select your preferred media format in the settings menu advanced video menu setting.  MediaRecorder makes small chucks of recording and these recorded blob chunks temporary stored in IndexedDB, if IndexedDB implemented in your browser. Otherwise it stores blobs in memory in an array of blobs.
Local Recording creates a local IndexedDB with the name of the starting timestamp (unix timestamp format)  And a storage called chunks. All chunks read in an array and created a final blob that you can download. After blobs array concatenation as a big blob, this big blob saved as file, and finally we delete the temporary local IndexedDB.

* Local recording is **disabled** by default. It could be enabled by setting _localRecordingEnabled_ to true in  (./app/public/config/config.js)

* **WARNING**: Take care that local recording will increase cpu, memory and disk space consumption.
**Enough free disk space has to be provided!!!**
Keep in mind that Browsers don't allow to use all the disk free capacity!
